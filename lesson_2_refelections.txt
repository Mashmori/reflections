How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the working directory can include file that are not trucked by git while the staging area is where you add the files to be trucked by git
the repository contains the commits which is snapshot of all files in spesific time 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I should stage each related files and commit them than stage the others which are irrelated and commit them.
In other word, I should stage only the files which include one logical change and commit them,and so on.
